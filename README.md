# Blog Post Helper
This is the program I developed to help me manage my posts on Blogger. Blogger does some weird things to things inside posts, and I got tired of removing and updating the changes that Blogger makes manually. Since I had nothing to do and since I wanted to code something, I built this. This "post helper" helps me by doing the following:

* Removing the extra padding Blogger adds to images.
* Changing the quality of images by changing the "s1600" value in the URL of an image to "s0."
* Embedding YouTube videos.
* Adding custom styles to a post.

This repository contains code written in C#.
